The Pitcairn Islands is a group of four volcanic islands in the southern part of Polynesia. Nowadays, it is the sole overseas territory of Great Britain in the Pacific Ocean and the least populated place in the world. Their capital and the only town there is Adamstown; its population counts approximately 50 people. These isles were inhabited in 1790 by British seafarers that went to Tahiti for seeds of Bread Tree to trade. Spent five months on Tahiti, the Bounty vesselâ€™s crew raised a mutiny, seized a ship, exiled a captain, and absconded to this outlying island with a group of Tahitian women. After that, they burned a vessel to hide evidence of their crime and cut off escape routes, and organized a settlement there.
