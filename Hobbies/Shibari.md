## The Rope Dress
- 12-meters rope should be used
- find a center bite of the rope by folding it half and pinching it together
- bring either sides of the rope over the neck and create a simple overhand knot leaving 2 inches of loop
- hold the knot in between the shoulder blades and create a second knot just underneath the collarbone (ключица)
- create more knots in the center of the sternum (грудина), center of the rib cage, bellybutton
- pay attention to knots in a way that the rope should not overlap in knots, also change the direction of the knots to keep the both sides of the rope equal
- create one more knot that on females would sit on the clitoris, or on males sit just behind the balls
- bring the rope between the legs and up through the initial loop
- separate the rope and bring them over the both sides of the partner above the breasts, pull them through the loop in the front between the 1 and the 2 knot, then pull back. Tighten the rope 
- bring the right hand one rope over the centerline, then the second rope over the first, and then pull this second rope below these two to create a friction knot
- keeping the ropes tight, bring them again to the front under the breasts, pulling them through the loop between 2 and 3 knot and back, making the friction knot over the centerline again
- repeat the previous step between knots 3 and 4, 4 and 5
- secure the last friction knot bringing the right-hand rope over the left, up through and pull tight. This completes the knot
- any excess rope can simply be tucked up and down the length of the body
