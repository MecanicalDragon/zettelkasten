Zettelkasten is a way to store and structure information that was invented by German sociologist Niclas Luman. The word zettelkasten consists of two roots: Zettel, which means a note, and Kasten - a box; thus, zettelkasten literally means a box with notes. Zettelkasten of Niklas Luman was a set of racks; each had several drawers filled with paper cards. Every card contained distinct, separate notion and had a unique index that comprised pointers to cards with related thoughts, derivative thoughts, and just comments. This system allowed Luman to stash more than 90 thousand notes, which he used to write above 70 books and 400 scientific articles in only 40 years.
